[Lakitu](http://www.zenetproject.com/pages/lakitu) is a research project from UC Santa Cruz's [Expressive Intelligence Studio](http://eis-blog.ucsc.edu). It uses the [Zenet framework](http://www.zenetproject.com) to monitor events from a Super Mario World-style game, and issues repairs when the game fails. It is the smallest complete implementation of the Zenet architecture.

The game can be switched between the correct, original, implementation, and a buggy implementation that contains examples from as many applicable [video game failure taxonomy categories](http://www.zenetproject.com/pages/taxonomy) as possible.

It is a clone of [Infinite Mario Bros](http://www.mojang.com/notch/mario/), converted to use a rule engine to specify game integrity.
